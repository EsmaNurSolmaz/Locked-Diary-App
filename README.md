# Locked Diary App

## Overview

Locked Diary App is a secure mobile application built with React Native and Firebase. It allows users to maintain private diary entries that are encrypted with end-to-end encryption for maximum security. Each entry is encrypted with a unique key provided by the user during login, ensuring that only the user who created the entry can decrypt and view it. This application is ideal for those looking to keep their personal notes safe from unauthorized access, offering a high level of privacy and protection.


## Features

- **Secure Storage:** All diary entries are encrypted and stored securely in Firebase Firestore.
- **Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and reset their passwords using Firebase Authentication.
